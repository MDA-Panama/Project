So instead let's run a PCA to see how a purely data-driven technique would allocate the variability of our regressors if it was constrained to two or three components. We'll now be leaving out the grouped variables (fossil, renewables, low carbon). Let's first take a look again at the variances of each variable. Since PCA as a method relies on grouping together variance, these large differences in magnitude will be problematic. Variables like 'solar_share_energy' and 'biofuel_share_energy' are unlikely to have any meaningful loadings."
